Phase 1:
- deploying the token
- deploying the staking solidity and sending it to the token / cisla eth contract address
- verifying on etherscan so people don't think it's a scam
- after verification on etherscan we proceed to phase 2

Phase 2:
- adding lliquidity pool on uniswap i guess
- balancing the price from the smart chain and ether 
- question 1 "hey wiseman how can we balance the price of bsc cisla and eth cisla?"
- my answer is "we can deploy a lot of ether in liquidity pool or the cisla developers from bsc will buy the ether so the price getting boost

- question 2 "hey what if they transfer cisla from bsc to eth but the price is different would be the market will be affected?
- my answer is "No, if they tranfer 1k usd worth of cisla from bsc they're gonna get 1k usd worth in eth as well but different ammount of token
- after this proceed to phase 3

Phase 3:
- building our own DEX Platform or Decentralized Exchange Platform
- adding our own bsc cisla and eth cisla so people can easily transfer it.
